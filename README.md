# Drum_Kit

This project is a virtual drum kit that lets you play different sounds and rhythms. I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the functionality, interface, and appearance of the drum kit. The drum kit consists of seven drum pads, each with a corresponding letter on the keyboard. You can play the drums by either clicking on the pads with your mouse or pressing the keys on your keyboard. The project showcases my skills in JavaScript and my creativity in making music.
